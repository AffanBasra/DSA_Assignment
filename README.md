README for Scheduling Process and Primality Testing
Overview
This repository contains two C++ programs designed to solve different computational problems: a scheduling process and primality testing for large numbers.

Problem 1: Scheduling Process
This program implements a scheduling algorithm to efficiently manage a set of tasks. It takes into account various factors like task duration and dependencies to optimize the scheduling order.
Problem 2: Primality Testing
This program performs primality testing on large integers using a probabilistic method. It checks whether a given integer is prime and can handle large numbers beyond the limits of standard data types.
Features
Task Scheduling:

Implements a scheduling algorithm that organizes tasks based on their duration and dependencies.
Allows user-defined inputs for tasks, making it adaptable to different scenarios.
Primality Testing:

Uses the Miller-Rabin probabilistic method for checking the primality of large integers.
Supports large integers up to 1024 bits, utilizing a linked list structure for efficient number handling.
Assumptions
Input for the scheduling program should include task details and dependencies.
The primality testing program assumes positive integers as input.


Challenges
Efficiently managing task scheduling and optimizing the order of tasks based on various constraints.
Handling large numbers in primality testing and implementing modular arithmetic for accuracy.
Conclusion
These programs showcase different approaches to solving computational problems in C++. They demonstrate the ability to manage scheduling tasks and perform efficient primality testing. Feel free to contribute or modify the code to fit your needs.
